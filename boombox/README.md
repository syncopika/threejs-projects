# boombox idea
    
A 3D boombox :D    
    
The boombox model utilizes shape keys (morph targets in Three.js) to transform the play/stop buttons of the model, for rotating the dial to change the lowpass filter frequency and for enlarging the meshes of the speakers based on the audio data.    
This demo also adds spatial audio and a lowpass filter with the help of the Web Audio API.
