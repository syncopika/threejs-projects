todo:
- import/export of marker+path data so we can demonstrate some useful ideas
- make a useful demo
- add some ui components to represent 'scenes'? i.e. 1 path == 1 scene?
- be able to change speed
- make camera movement smoother? that probably has to do with speed...
- smooth turning about angles? bezier curves?
