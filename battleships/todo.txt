TODO:

- prevent movement through obstacles?
  - check for collisions within player unit's select area (the yellow circle)?

- enemy movement

- ship animation? (e.g. moving cannons, cannon smoke)

- brighter sky, night sky options?

- fix perspective camera? (when using orbit control and rotating the camera, the ships sometimes disappear. is that a camera parameter issue?) 

- figure out why sometimes things don't show in orthographic camera until a certain y position is reached? 
  e.g. the player selectarea needs to be at or past a certain y value to show up in the orthographic camera

- more ships
